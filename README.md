This is a basic Vapor 3 application created from the fantastic [Server Side Swift with Vapor](https://videos.raywenderlich.com/courses/115-server-side-swift-with-vapor/lessons/1) course by Tim Condon on [RayWenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com).

I have added a few additional features to the app and will continue to use it as a testing/demo repository as I learn various aspects of Vapor 3. I hope this can also be used as an example of how various features are implemented in Vapor 3, so feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
